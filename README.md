# Client Kill Switch REST-Api

## About
This is a small REST-API I've coded on the GPN21, to help me securely distribute software demos to my customers.
The code is everything but clean right now and there are probably a lot of bugs and insecurities, but I will fix them in the near future whenever I've got time for it.
The code is meant to run on a self-hosted server, though it only got tested locally, as of right now.

## Documentation
There is no documentation available yet, it will be added in the future

## Planned updates
1. Clean up code, make it more readable and add comments
2. Provide encryption for the config.json file
3. Bug fixes
4. Migrate to test-driven development
