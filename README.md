# Client Kill Switch REST-Api

## About
This REST API is written to check whether an application is "allowed" to start.
A use case for that is following scenario: A freelance-developer makes a software
demo for a customer and wants to control for how long that demo is able to start.

The API is made to fully trust the server and not the client, not even with timestamps.

## Documentation
There is no documentation available yet, it will be added in the future
